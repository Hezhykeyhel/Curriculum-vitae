                    <h3>Objectives</h3>
                        <p>
                                I am a trained and an enthusiastic school teacher with high aspirations for students, committed to supporting growth in children and enabling them to realize their learning objectives. An agent for positive change. I believe in helping a child discover his talent, help the child utilize the skills and as well help such child explore the world and find his/her own place in it.<br>
                                My love for teaching is demonstrated in my students’ exam results; at least an average of 84% of my students have achieved grades B or Higher.<br>
                                I strongly believe that, as far as any task is within or beyond my capabilities, I’ll  do wonders in any task assigned to me either in the school settings or any organization as well as largely contributing my quota to the development of such firm irrespective of the situation at hand.
